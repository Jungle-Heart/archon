# Archon

Archon is an agentic framework for iteratively building AI agents, starting with simple Pydantic models and evolving into more complex agents using LangGraph.

## Vision

Develop Archon through iterations:

1. Simple Pydantic AI agent that can build other Pydantic AI agents
2. Pydantic AI workflow to build more complex agents 
3. LangGraph agentic workflow to build agents with any framework

Showcase the power of planning, feedback loops, and domain knowledge in creating robust AI capabilities.
